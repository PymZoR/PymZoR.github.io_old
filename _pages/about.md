My name is Axel Mousset. I'm passionated in everything that revolves around computers, from electronics to programming including robotics.  

I currently study computer engineering at the University of Technology of Troyes (France). I'm looking for an internship.

You can take a look at [my projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) to see some things I've worked on, and find my resume in [english]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume/CV_MOUSSET_Axel_en.pdf) and [french]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/resume/CV_MOUSSET_Axel_fr.pdf).

## About this blog
I've always considered knowledge should be an open source.  
This blog aims to be a personnal diary. I post things I consider either interesting, useful, or things I simply want to write.  

If you have remarks, or simply want to have a talk, feel free to [contact]({{ site.baseurl/contact/ }}) me.
